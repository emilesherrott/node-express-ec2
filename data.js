    story: `Not surprisingly, the tiger ran a good race but the current in the river sent it a little off-course. It recovered enough to cross the line behind the ox and so comes in at number three in the Chinese zodiac. Next up was the rabbit. Also tired by the race, it almost came a cropper in the river but saved itself on a floating log and got to shore to finish fourth. In fifth place is the only mythical creature on the calendar, the dragon. A kinder creature than legend suggests, it didn’t hesitate to divert from the race to extinguish a fire which was endangering the lives of some nearby villagers. Once it got back on course, it saw the rabbit struggling and used its breath to blow it safely to shore. The rabbit never learned who came to its aid while the dragon was content to finish behind it.`,

However, it hadn’t noticed that the snake was saving energy by wrapping itself around the horse’s leg to hitch a ride.

    story: `Now we’re just left with the dog and the pig. Dog owners won’t be surprised that the playful hound was more interested in splashing about in the river rather than crossing it. This enabled the first 10 creatures to overtake it. It eventually ran over the line in 11th place. Which leaves the pig. The pig got peckish during the race. After stopping for food, it became sleepy and dozed off. It did wake up after a while and managed to make it over the line in last place. The Emperor had almost given up on it but was happy to assign it the final space in the zodiac.`,
